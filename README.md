#The male and female husband: or, A strange and wonderful relation how a midwife living at St. Albans, being brought to bed of an hermophrodite, brought it up in womans apparel, and carryed it with her as her deputy to be assisting at the labours of several women, going under the name of Mary Jewit: and how at last a discovery of it was made by it lying with a maid, and getting her with-child, whom the said hermophrodite was thereupon obliged to marry: with a particular account of the trades and imployments it was put to during its minority. With several pleasant passages that happened. To the tune of, What shall I do, shall I dye for love, &c.#
